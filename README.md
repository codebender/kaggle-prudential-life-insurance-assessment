# Kaggle.com - Prudential Life Insurance Assessment

### Can you make buying life insurance easier?

Picture this. You are a data scientist in a start-up culture with the potential to have a very large impact on the business. Oh, and you are backed up by a company with 140 years' business experience.

Curious? Great! You are the kind of person we are looking for.

[Prudential](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment/details/about-prudential), one of the largest issuers of life insurance in the USA, is hiring passionate data scientists to join a newly-formed Data Science group solving complex challenges and identifying opportunities. The results have been impressive so far but we want more. 

#### The Challenge

In a one-click shopping world with on-demand ![](https://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/4699/media/iStock_insurancehands300.png)everything, the life insurance application process is antiquated. Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.

The result? People are turned off. That’s why only 40% of U.S. households own individual life insurance. Prudential wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.

By developing a predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a more automated approach, you can greatly impact public perception of the industry.

The results will help Prudential better understand the predictive power of the data points in the existing assessment, enabling us to significantly streamline the process.
